## What is Field Pathing?

When we reason about ASP.NET MVC, routing comes naturally. We define a URL and perform an HTTP request to fetch data.

```
GET http://homeMadeBakery.local/pastries/donuts/15
```

and we can picture how this might map to an API Controller:

```csharp
[Route("pastries")]
public class PastriesController : Controller
{
    [HttpGet("donuts/{id}")]
    public Donut RetrieveDonut(int id)
    {/* ... */}
}
```

When you startup an MVC or Web API application .NET gathers your configured routes and maintains a map of `endpoint -> action method` in order to hand off an HTTP request to a given method.

OK, Great! Now lets think about this graphQL query:

```javascript
query {
    pastries {
        donut(id: 15){
            name
            flavor
        }
    }
}
```

We can think about each field in the query as a unique path in our schema, similar to the URL above:

```ruby
[query]
[query]/pastries
[query]/pastries/donut
[type]/donut/name
[type]/donut/flavor
```

In fact, this is how GraphQL ASP.NET knows how to invoke your methods. At startup, a complete map of the query and mutation methods as well as every graph type is translated into a set of field paths. Then, when a request is made of a field, it invokes the method or property associated with that `field path`.

> All action methods, graph type properties and graph type methods must map to a unique field path in your graph schema.

```csharp
[GraphRoute("pastries")]
public class PastriesController : GraphController
{
    [Query("donut")]
    public Donut RetrieveDonut(int id)
    {/* ...*/}

}
```

This is a different controller than in the top example. We inherit from `GraphController` and use `Query` instead of `Controller` and `HttpGet`, respectively.

You can nest fields as deep as you need in order to create a rich organizational hierarchy to your data. This is best explained by code, take a look at these two controllers:

```csharp

// BakeryController.cs
[GraphRoute("groceryStore/bakery")]
public class BakeryController : GraphController
{
    [Query("pastries/search")]
    public IEnumerable<IPastry> SearchPastries(string nameLike)
    {/* ... */}

    [Query("pastries/recipe")]
    public Recipe RetrieveRecipe(int id)
    {/* ... */}

    [Query("breadCounter/orders")]
    public IEnumerable<BreadOrder> FindOrders(int customerId)
    {/* ... */}
}

// PharmacyController.cs
[GraphRoute("groceryStore/pharmacy")]
public class PharmacyController : GraphController
{
    [Query("employees/search")]
    public IPastry SearchEmployees(string nameLike)
    {/* ... */}

    [QueryRoot("pharmacyHours")]
    public HoursOfOperation RetrievePharmacyHours(DayOfTheWeek day)
    {/* ... */}

    [Query("orders")]
    public IEnumerable<Prescription> FindOrders(int customerId)
    {/* ... */}
}
```

And this single query we can perform:

```javascript
query SearchGroceryStore {
    groceryStore {
        bakery {
            pastries {
                search(nameLike: "chocolate"){
                    name
                    type
                }
                recipe(id: 15) {
                    name
                    ingredients {
                        name
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        pharmacy {
            orders(customerId: 45123){
                dayOrdered
                type
                doctorsName
            }
        }
    }
    pharmacyHours(day: MONDAY){
        openAt
        closeAt
    }
}
```

With REST, this is probably 4 separate requests or one super contrived request but with GraphQL and a carefully thought out set of field paths we can model our data hierarchy quickly and without over complicating the code. There is no more code in this example than would be required by a REST API; we've just changed how its interpreted at runtime.

## Actions Must Have a Unique Path

As was said above, each field in your object graph must uniquely map to one method (or getter property) in your code.

Take this example:

<div class="sideBySideCode hljs">
<div>

```csharp
// C# Controller
public class BakeryController : GraphController
{
    [QueryRoot]
    public Donut RetrieveDonutType(int id){/*...*/}
}

public class Donut
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public Icing Icing { get; set; }
}

public class Icing
{
    public IcingType Type { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public bool MegaSugar { get; set; }
}
```

</div>
<div>

```javascript
query {
    donut(id: 5){
        id
        name
        icing {
            type
            name
            megaSugar
        }
    }
}
```

</div>
</div>
<br/>

We can identify 8 unique fields:

```ruby
[query]                     // the top level query type
[query]/retrieveDonutType   // the root level action method
[type]/donut/id             // the id property of the donut object
[type]/donut/name
[type]/donut/icing
[type]/icing/type
[type]/icing/name
[type]/icing/megaSugar
```

But what about method overloading?

```csharp
// C# Controller
[GraphRoute("bakery")]
public class BakeryController : GraphController
{
    // Both Methods represent the same 'orderDonuts' field on the object graph
    [Mutation]
    public Manager OrderDonuts(int quantity){/*...*/}

    [Mutation]
    public Manager OrderDonuts(string type, int quantity){/*...*/}
}
```

Since both methods map to a field path of `[mutation]/bakery/orderDonuts` this would cause a `GraphTypeDeclarationException` to be thrown when your application starts.

With MVC the ASP.NET runtime could inspect any combinations of parameters passed on the query string or the POST body to work out which overload to call. You might be thinking, why can't GraphQL inspect the passed input arguments and make the same determination?

In some cases it probably could. But looking at this example we run into an issue:

```csharp
// C# Controller
[GraphRoute("bakery")]
public class BakeryController : GraphController
{
    // Both Methods represent the same 'orderDonuts' field on the object graph
    [Mutation]
    public Manager OrderDonuts(int quantity, string type){/*...*/}

    [Mutation]
    public Manager OrderDonuts(string type, int quantity){/*...*/}
}
```

We'd pair these methods with different URL fragments and could work out which method to call in a REST request based on the full structure of the URL.

However, the GraphQL specification states that input arguments can be passed in any order [Spec ยง [2.6](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/October2021/#sec-Language.Arguments)]. GraphQL, by definition, does not supply enough information in its query syntax to decide which overload to invoke. To combat the issue, the runtime will reject any field that it can't uniquely identify.

No problem through, there are a number of ways fix the conflict.

### Declare Explicit Names

One approach is to declare explicit names for each of your methods. Not only does this resolve the conflict but should an errant refactor of your code occur, your graph fields won't magically be renamed to their new method names and break your front-end.

```csharp
// C# Controller
[GraphRoute("bakery")]
public class BakeryController : GraphController
{
    // GraphQL treats these fields differently!
    [Mutation("orderDonutsByQuantity")]
    public Manager OrderDonuts(int quantity){/*...*/}

    [Mutation("orderDonutsByType")]
    public Manager OrderDonuts(string type, int quantity){/*...*/}
}
```

Now we have unique field paths:

```ruby
[query]/bakery/orderDonutsByQuantity
[query]/bakery/orderDonutsByType
```

But this can feel a bit awkward in some situations so instead...

### Change The Hierarchy

Another alternative is to change where in the object graph the field sits. Here we've moved one field to the root mutation type and left the other under the controller's own `bakery` field. This can be a good strategy if you have one primary way of interacting with your data and a few auxillary methods such as a quick dozen donuts at the drive thru window or going into the shop and selecting which ones you want.

<div class="sideBySideCode hljs">
<div>

```csharp
// C# Controller
[GraphRoute("bakery")]
public class BakeryController : GraphController
{
    [MutationRoot("orderDonuts")]
    public IEnumerable<Donut> OrderDonuts(int count)
    {/*...*/}

    [Mutation("orderDonuts")]
    public IEnumerable<Donut> OrderDonuts(
        string type,
        int count)
    {/*...*/}
}
```

</div>
<div>

```javascript
mutation {
    orderDonuts(count: 12){
        name
        flavor
    }
}
```

```javascript
mutation {
    bakery {
        orderDonuts(
                type: "Chocolate"
                count: 3){
            name
            flavor
        }
    }
}
```

</div>
</div>
<br/>

And the unique field paths are:

```ruby
[mutation]/orderDonuts
[mutation]/bakery/orderDonuts
```

### Combine the Fields

Lastly, we can make use of input objects with optional fields and combine parameters into a more robust method.

```csharp
// BakeryController.cs
[GraphRoute("bakery")]
public class BakeryController : GraphController
{
    [Mutation("orderDonuts")]
    public IEnumerable<Donut> OrderDonuts(DonutOrderModel order)
    {/*...*/}
}

// DonutOrderModel.cs
public class DonutOrderModel
{
    public int? Quantity { get; set; }
    public string Type { get; set; }
}
```

Which can be called by either of these mutations:

```javascript
mutation byQuantity {
    bakery{
        orderDonuts (order: {quantity: 12}){
            id
            type
        }
    }
}

mutation byType {
    bakery{
        orderDonuts (order: {type: "Chocolate" quantity: 12}){
            id
            type
        }
    }
}

```

When you start thinking about large object graphs, 100s of controllers and 100s of types, you have to put some thought in to how you organize your data. Coming up with an intuitive structure to your hierarchy is going to be dependent on your audience and use cases. There is no one-size fits all approach, but with the ability to move graph fields by updating one string, its trivial to build as you iterate.

## Field Path Names

> Each segment of a field path must individually conform to the required naming standards for fields and graph type names.

In reality this primarily means don't start your fields with a double underscore, `__`, as thats reserved by the introspection system. The complete regex is available in the source code at `Constants.RegExPatterns.NameRegex`.

These are some valid field paths:

```csharp
// Valid Field Fragments
[Mutation("store/bakery/deliCounter/sandwiches/order")]
[Mutation("path1/path2/path3/path4/")]
[Mutation("path1/path1/path1/path1/path1/path1/path1/path1/path1")]
```

But if even one segment of the path is invalid GraphQL will reject it completely.

```csharp
// ERROR: Invalid Field Fragments
[Query("store/__bakery")]
[Query("store/ฮฒakery")]
[Query("path1/path2/path 33")]
```

### Schema Naming Formats

At runtime, when your schema is generated, the naming requirements it defines will be enforced for each path segment. By default this means `camelCasing` on field names.

If you declare:

```csharp
[Mutation("Store/Bakery/DeliCounter")]
```

You would still query with :

```javascript
mutation {
    store {
        bakery {
            deliCounter {
                ...

        }
    }
}
```

You can alter the naming formats for fields, enum values and graph types using the declaration options on your [schema configuration](../reference/schema-configuration).
