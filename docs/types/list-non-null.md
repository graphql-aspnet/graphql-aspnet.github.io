In addition to the six fundamental graph types, GraphQL contains two meta graph types; [`LIST` and `NON_NULL`](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#lists-and-non-null).

-   `NON_NULL` : Indicates that the Graph Type its describing must not be a null value, be that as an input argument or returned from a field
-   `LIST`: Indicates that GraphQL should expect a collection of objects instead of just a single item.

These meta types aren't anything concrete like a scalar or an enum. Instead they "wrap" another graph type (such as `int` or `Donut`). They describe the usage of a graph type in a field or input argument:

For example, we would say:

-   "A field that returns a list of `integers`."
-   "A field that must return a `person`."
-   "An input argument that must be a list of `Dates`."

We can even describe complex scenarios:

-   "A field that might return a collection of `persons` but when returned, each person must be a valid reference."
-   "An input argument that must be a list that contains lists of `integers`."
    -   e.g. `[[1, 2], [5, 15]]`

## Type Expressions

Together these "wrappers" make up a field's `Type Expression`. GraphQL ASP.NET will automatically infer a type expression for every field and every input argument when generating your schema.

GraphQL ASP.NET makes the following assumptions about your data when creating type expressions:

-   Reference types **can be** null
-   Value types **cannot be** null
-   Nullable value types (e.g. `int?`) **can be** be null
-   When a reference type implements `IEnumerable<TType>` it will be expressed as a "list of `TType`"

Type Expressions are commonly shown in the GraphQL schema syntax for field definitions. Here are a few examples of a .NET type and its equivalent type expression in schema syntax.

| .NET Type                               | Type Expression |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| int                                   | Int!          |
| float?                                | Float         |
| IEnumerable&lt;Person&gt;                   | [Person]      |
| Person[]                               | [Person]      |
| List&lt;bool&gt;                            | [Boolean!]    |
| IReadOnlyList&lt;long&gt;                  | [Long!]        |
| IReadOnlyList&lt;long?&gt;                  | [Long]        |
| IEnumerable&lt;List&lt;ICollection&lt;Donut&gt;&gt;&gt; | [[[Donut]]]   |

##### The `!` indicates NON_NULL and `[]` for a LIST.

#### Overriding Type Expressions

You may need to override the default behavior from time to time. For instance, a `string`, which is a reference type, is nullable by default but you may need to require a string be supplied in an input argument.

You can override the default behavior by defining a [custom type expression](../advanced/type-expressions) when needed.

## Runtime Type Validation

When executing a query and resolving a field, should one of your graph methods (or even your object properties) not return data conforming to the type expression that's defined for it, GraphQL will reject the data. The value is set to null and an error is registered in the response for the field in question. The runtime will not attempt to resolve any referenced child fields for a rejected value.

If the rejected field does not allow nulls, the error is propagated up to its parent, which is then also set to null. If that parent field can't return a null value the error continues up the chain until it reaches a field that can be null or the entire field collection is nulled out. \[Spec ยง [6.4.4](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/October2021/#sec-Errors-and-Non-Nullability)\]
