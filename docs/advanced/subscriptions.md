## Initial Setup

Successfully handling subscriptions in your GraphQL server can be straight forward for single server environments or very complicated for multi-server and scalable solutions. First we'll look at adding subscriptions for a single server.

### Install the Subscriptions Package

The first step to using subscriptions is to install the subscription server package.

```powershell title="Install The Library"
# Using the dotnet CLI
> dotnet add package GraphQL.AspNet.Subscriptions --prerelease

# using Package Manager Console
> Install-Package GraphQL.AspNet.Subscriptions -IncludePrerelease
```

This adds the necessary components to create a subscription server for a given schema such as communicating with web sockets, parsing subscription queries and responding to events.

### Configure the Server Instance

You must configure web socket support for your Asp.Net server instance separately. The ways in which you perform this configuration will vary widely depending on your CORS requirements, keep-alive support and other needs.

After web sockets are added to your server, add subscription support to the graphql registration.

```csharp title="Add Subscription Support at Startup"
// configuring services at startup
// ---------------
services.AddWebSockets(/*...*/);

services.AddGraphQL()
// highlight-next-line
        .AddSubscriptions();

// building the application pipeline
// ---------------
app.UseWebSockets();
// highlight-next-line
app.UseGraphQL();    
```

:::tip 
 Don't forget to call `.UseWebsockets()` before calling `.UseGraphQL()`. 
:::

### Create a Subscription

Declaring a subscription is the same as declaring a query or mutation on a controller but with `[Subscription]` and `[SubscriptionRoot]` attributes. Feel free to mix subscriptions with your queries and mutations. They do not need to be kept seperate.

```csharp title="SubscriptionController.cs"
public class SubscriptionController : GraphController
{
    // other code not shown for brevity

    // highlight-next-line
    [SubscriptionRoot("onWidgetChanged", typeof(Widget), EventName = "WIDGET_CHANGED")]
    public IGraphActionResult  OnWidgetChanged(Widget eventData, string filter){
        if(eventData.Name.StartsWith(filter))
        {
            // send the data down to the listening client
            return this.Ok(eventData);
        }
        else
        {
            // use SkipSubscriptionEvent() to disregard the data
            // and not communicate anything to the listening client 
            return this.SkipSubscriptionEvent();
        }
    }
}
```
Here we've declared a new subscription, one that takes in a `filter` parameter to restrict the data that any subscribers receive.

A query to invoke this subscription may look like this:

```graphql title="Sample Subscription Query"
subscription {
    onWidgetChanged(filter: "Big"){
        id
        name
        description
    }
}
```

Any updated widgets that start with the phrase "Big" will then be sent to the requestor as they are changed on the server. Any other changed widgets will be skipped/dropped and no data will be sent to the client.

### Publish a Subscription Event

In order for the subscription server to send data to any subscribers it has to be notified when its time to do so. It does this via named Subscription Events. These are internal, schema-unique keys (strings) that identify when something happened, usually via a mutation. Once the mutation publishes an event, the subscription server will execute the appropriate action method for any subscribers, using the supplied data, and deliver the results to the client.

```csharp title="MutationController.cs"
public class MutationController : GraphController
{
    // other code not shown for brevity

    [MutationRoot("updateWidget", typeof(Widget))]
    public async Task<IGraphActionResult> OnWidgetChanged(int id, string name){
        var widget = _service.RetrieveWidget(id);
        widget.Name = name;

        await _service.UpdateWidget(widget);

        // publish a new event to let any subscribers know
        // something changed
        // highlight-next-line
        this.PublishSubscriptionEvent("WIDGET_CHANGED", widget);
        return this.Ok(widget);
    }
}
```

:::info Event Names Must Match
 Notice that the event name used in `PublishSubscriptionEvent()` is the same as the `EventName` property on the `[SubscriptionRoot]` attribute above. This is how the subscription server knows what published event is tied to which subscription. This value is case-sensitive.
:::

### Subscription Event Data Source

In the example above, the data sent with `PublishSubscriptionEvent()` is the same as the first input parameter, called `eventData`, on the subscription method, which is the same as the return type of the subscription method. By default, GraphQL will look for a parameter with the same data type as the method's own return type and use that as the event data source. It will automatically populate this field with the data from `PublishSubscriptionEvent()`; this argument is not exposed in the object graph.

You can explicitly flag a different parameter, or a parameter of a different data type to be the expected event source with the `[SubscriptionSource]` attribute.

```csharp title="Custom Event Data Source"
public class SubscriptionController : GraphController
{
    [SubscriptionRoot("onWidgetChanged", typeof(Widget), EventName = "WIDGET_CHANGED")]
    public IGraphActionResult  OnWidgetChanged(
        // highlight-next-line
        [SubscriptionSource] WidgetInternal eventData,
        string filter)
    {
        if(eventData.Name.StartsWith(filter))
            return this.Ok(eventData.ToWidget());
        return this.SkipSubscriptionEvent();
    }
}
```

Here the subscription expects that an event is published using a `WidgetInternal` that it will convert to a `Widget` and send to any subscribers. This can be useful if you wish to share internal objects between your mutations and subscriptions that you don't want publicly exposed.

:::info Event Data Objects Must Match
 The data object published with `PublishSubscriptionEvent()` must have the same type as the `[SubscriptionSource]` on the subscription field.
:::

### Summary

That's all there is for a basic subscription server setup:

1. Add the package reference and update your startup code.
2. Declare a new subscription on a controller using `[Subscription]` or `[SubscriptionRoot]`.
3. Publish an event (usually from a mutation).

### Apollo Client Example

ðŸ“Œ A complete example of single instance subscription server including a react app that utilizes the Apollo Client is available in the [demo projects](../reference/demo-projects) section.

## Subscription Action Results

You saw above the special action result `SkipSubscriptionEvent()` used to instruct graphql to skip the received event and not tell the client about it; this can be very useful in scenarios where the subscription supplies filter data to only receive some very specific data and not all items published via a specific event.

Here is a complete list of the various "subscription specific" action results:

* `SkipSubscriptionEvent()` - Instructs the server to skip the raised event, the client will not receive any data.
* `OkAndComplete(data)` - Works just like `this.Ok()` but ends the subscription after the event is completed.  The client is informed that no additional data will be sent and that the server is closing the subscription permanently. This, however; does not close the underlying websocket connection.

:::danger Be Careful With Sensitive Data
All active subscriptions, from all connected users, have an opportunity to handle data published via `PublishSubscriptionEvent()`.

If there are scenarios where an event payload should not be shared with a user, be sure to enforce that business logic in your subscription method and use `SkipSubscriptionEvent()` for a given payload. 
:::

## Scaling Subscription Servers

Using web sockets has a natural limitation in that any single server instance has a maximum number of socket connections that it can realistically handle before being overloaded. Additionally, all cloud providers impose an artifical limit for many of their pricing tiers. Once that limit is reached no additional clients can connect, even if the server has capacity.

Ok no problem, just scale horizontally, right? Spin up additional server instances, add a load balancer and have the new requests open a web socket connection to these additional server instances...Not so fast!

With the examples above, events published by any mutation using `PublishSubscriptionEvent()` are routed internally, directly to the local subscription server meaning only those clients connected to the server instance where the event was raised will receive it. Clients connected to other server instances will never know the event occured. This represents a big problem for large scale websites, so what do we do?

[This diagram](../assets/2022-10-subscription-server.pdf) shows a high level difference between the default, single server configuration and a custom scalable solution.

### Custom Event Publishing

Instead of publishing events internally, within the server instance, we need to publish our events to some intermediate source such that any server can be notified of the change. There are a variety of technologies to handle this scenario; be it a common database or messaging technologies like RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus etc.

#### Implement `ISubscriptionEventPublisher`

Whatever your technology of choice the first step is to create and register a custom publisher that implements `ISubscriptionEventPublisher`. How your publisher class functions will vary widely depending on your implementation.

```csharp title="ISubscriptionEventPublisher.cs"
public interface ISubscriptionEventPublisher
{
    Task PublishEventAsync(SubscriptionEvent eventData);
}
```

Register your publisher with the DI container BEFORE calling `.AddGraphQL()` and  GraphQL ASP.NET will use your registered publisher instead of its default, internal publisher.

```csharp title="Register Your Event Publisher"
// highlight-next-line
services.AddSingleton<ISubscriptionEventPublisher, MyEventPublisher>();

services.AddGraphQL()
        .AddSubscriptions();
```


:::caution 
Publishing Subscription Events externally is not trivial. You'll have to deal with concerns like data serialization, package size etc. All of which are specific to your application and environment.
:::


### Consuming Published Events

At this point, we've successfully published our events to some external data source. Now we need to consume them. How that occurs is, again, implementation specific. Perhaps you run a background hosted service to watch for messages on an Azure Service Bus topic or perhaps you periodically pole a database table to look for new events. The ways in which data may be shared is endless.

Once you rematerialize a `SubscriptionEvent` you need to let GraphQL know that it occurred. this is done using the `ISubscriptionEventRouter`. In general, you won't need to implement your own router, just inject it into your listener then call `RaisePublishedEvent` and GraphQL will take it from there.

The router will take care of the details in figuring out which schema the event is destined for, which clients have active subscriptions etc. and forward it accordingly.

```csharp title="Example Custom Event Listener Service"
 public class MyListenerService : BackgroundService
    {
        private readonly ISubscriptionEventRouter _router;
        private bool _notStopped = true;

        public MyListenerService(ISubscriptionEventRouter router)
        {
            _router = router;
        }

       protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken cancelToken)
        {
            while (_notStopped)
            {
                SubscriptionEvent eventData = /* fetch next event */;
                // highlight-next-line
                _router.RaisePublishedEvent(eventData);
            }
        }
    }
```

:::info 
The above example is made using [`Background Services`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/hosted-services?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio). A feature of the modern ASP.NET stack.
:::



### Azure Service Bus Example

ðŸ“Œ A functional example, including serialization and deserialization using the Azure Service Bus is available in the [demo projects](../reference/demo-projects) section.

:::note
 The Azure Service Bus demo project represents a functional starting point and lacks a lot of the error handling and resilency needs of a production environment.
:::

## Partial Server Configuration

When using the `.AddSubscriptions()` extension method two seperate operations occur:

1. The subscription server components are registered to the DI container, the graphql execution pipeline is modified to support clients registering subscriptions and a middleware component is appended to the ASP.NET pipeline to intercept and communicate with web socket connections.

2. A middleware component is appended to the end of the graphql execution pipeline to formally publish any events staged via `PublishSubscriptionEvent()` 

Some applications may wish to split these operations in different server instances for managing load or just splitting different types of traffic. For example, having one set of servers dedicated to query/mutation operations (stateless requests) and others dedicated to handling subscriptions and websockets (stateful requests).

The following granular configuration options may be useful:

-   `.AddSubscriptionServer()` :: Only configures the ASP.NET pipeline to intercept websockets and adds the subscription server components to the DI container. Mutations found on this server instance will **NOT** be successful in publishing events.

-   `.AddSubscriptionPublishing()` :: Only configures the graphql execution pipeline to publish events. Subscription creation and websocket support is **NOT** enabled.

## Security & Query Authorization

Because subscriptions are long running, consume server resources and registered before any data is processed, the subscription server requires a [query authorization method](../reference/schema-configuration#authorization-options) of `PerRequest`. This allows the subscription to be fully validated before its registered with the server and ensure that any queries can actually be processed when needed. This authorization method is set at startup and will apply to queries and mutations as well. It is because of this that it may be useful to split your mutations and subscriptions into different server instances for larger applications, as mentioned above, depending on your reliance on partial query resolution.

This is different than the default behavior when subscriptions are not enabled. Queries and mutations, by default, will follow a `PerField` method allowing for partial query resolutions. 

:::caution
 Adding Subscriptions to your server will force the use of `PerRequest` Authorization
:::

## Query Timeouts

By default, the library does not define a timeout for an executed query. The query will run as long as the underlying connection is open. This is true for subscriptions as well. Given that the websocket connection is never closed while the end user is connected, any query executed through the websocket will be allowed to run for an infinite amount of time which can have some unintended side effects and consume resources unecessarily.

Optionally, you can define a query timeout for a given schema, which the subscription server will obey:

```csharp title="Adding a Query Timeout"
// startup code
services.AddGraphQL(o =>
{
    // define a 2 minute timeout per query or subscription event executed.
    o.ExecutionOptions.QueryTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2);
})
```

## Websocket Protocols

Out of the box, the library supports subscriptions over websockets using `graphql-transport-ws`, the modern protocol used by many client libraries. It also provides support for the legacy protocol `graphql-ws` (originally maintained by Apollo). A client requesting either protocol over a websocket will work with no additional configuration.

### Supported Protocols

-   [graphql-transport-ws](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md)
-   [graphql-ws](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) (_legacy_)

### Creating Custom Protocols

If you wish to add support for your own websocket messaging protocol you need to implement two interfaces:

- `ISubscriptionClientProxy<TSchema>` wraps a client connection, processes events and performs all necessary communications.
- `ISubscriptionClientProxyFactory` which is used create client proxy instances for your protocol.


```csharp title="ISubscriptionClientProxyFactory.cs"
public interface ISubscriptionClientProxyFactory
{
    // Create client proxy instances that
    // act as an intermediary to communicate server-side events
    // to the client connection
    Task<ISubscriptionClientProxy<TSchema>> CreateClient<TSchema>(IClientConnection connection)
        where TSchema : class, ISchema;

    // The unique name of your sub-protocol. A client connection requesting your
    // protocol, by name, will be handed to this
    // factory to create the appropriate client proxy.
    string Protocol { get; }
}
```

Inject the factory into your DI container before calling AddGraphQL:

```csharp title="Register Your Protocol Client Factory"
// startup
services.AddSingleton<ISubscriptionClientProxyFactory, MyClientProxyFactory>();

services.AddGraphQL()
        .AddSubscriptions();
```

:::caution Create a Singleton Factory
 `ISubscriptionClientProxyFactory` is expected to be a singleton; it is instantiated once when the server first comes online. The `ISubscriptionClientProxy<TSchema>`instances it creates should be unique per `IClientConnection` instance.
:::

The server will listen for subscription registrations from your client proxy and send back published events when new data is available. It is up to your proxy to interprete these events, generate an appropriate result (including executing queries against the runtime), serialize the data and send it to the connected client on the other end.

:::info Custom Protocols are Difficult
The complete details of implementing a custom graphql client proxy are beyond the scope of this documentation. Take a peek at the subscription library source code for some clues on how to get started.
:::

## Other Communication Options

While websockets is the primary medium for persistant connections its not the only option. Internally, the library supplies an `IClientConnection` interface which encapsulates a raw websocket received from ASP.NET. This interface is internally implemented as a `WebSocktClientConnection` which is responsible for reading and writing raw bytes to the socket. Its not a stretch of the imagination to implement your own custom client connection, invent a way to capture said connections and basically rewrite the entire communications layer of the subscriptions module.

Please do a deep dive into the subscription code base to learn about all the intricacies of building your own communications layer and how you might go about registering it with the runtime. If you do try to tackle this very large effort don't hesitate to reach out. We're happy to partner with you and meet you half way on a solution if it makes sense for the rest of the community.

## Performance Considerations

In a production app, its very possible that you may have lots of subscription events fired and communicated to a lot of connected clients in short succession. Its important to understand how the server will process those events and plan accordingly. 

When the router receives an event it looks to see which clients are subscribed to that event and queues up a work item for each one. If there are 5 clients registered to the single event, then 5 work items are queued. Internally, this work is processed asyncronously to a server-configured maximum. Once this maximum is reached, new work will only begin as other work finishes up.

Each work item is, for the most part, a single query execution. Though, if a client registers to a subscription multiple times each registration is executed as its own query. With lots of events being delivered on a server saturated with clients, each potentially having multiple subscriptions, along with regular queries and mutations executing...limits must be imposed otherwise CPU utilization could unreasonably spike...and it may spike regardless in some use cases. 

By default, the max number of work items the router will deliver simultaniously is `500`.  This is a global, server-wide pool, shared amongst all registered schemas. You can controller this value by changing it prior to calling `.AddGraphQL()`.   This value defaults to a low number on purpose, use it as a starting point to dial up the max concurrency to a level you feel comfortable with in terms of performance and cost. The only limit here is server resources and other environment limitations outside the control of graphql. 

```csharp title="Set A Receiver Throttle During Startup"
// Adjust the max concurrent communications value
// BEFORE calling .AddGraphQL()
// highlight-next-line
GraphQLSubscriptionServerSettings.MaxConcurrentReceiverCount = 500;

services.AddGraphQL()
        .AddSubscriptions();
```

:::note 
The max receiver count can easily be set in the 1000s. There is no magic bullet as to an appropriate value. It all depends on the number of events you are expecting, the number of subscribers and the workload of each event in your application.
:::

### Event Multiplication

Think carefully about your production scenarios when you introduce subscriptions into your application.  As mentioned above, for each subscription event raised, each subscription monitoring that event must execute a standard graphql query, with the supplied event data, to generate a result and send it to its connected client. 

If, for instance, you have `200 clients` connected to a single server, each with `3 subscriptions` against the same field, thats `600 individual queries` that must be executed to process a single event completely. Even if you call `SkipSubscriptionEvent` to drop the event and send no send data to a client, the query still must be executed to determine if the subscriber is not interested in the data. If you execute any database operations in your `[Subcription]` method, its going to be run 600 times.  Suppose your server receives 5 mutations in rapid succession, all of which raise the event, thats a spike of `3,000 queries`, instantaneously, that the server must process.  

Balancing the load can be difficult. Luckily there are some [throttling levers](/docs/reference/global-configuration#subscriptions) you can adjust.

:::danger Know Your User Traffic
 Raising subscription events can exponentially increase the load on each of your servers if not planned correctly. Think carefully when you deploy subscriptions to your application.
:::

### Dispatch Queue Monitoring

Internally, whenever a subscription server instance receives an event, the router checks to see which of the currently connected clients need to process that event. The client/event combination is then put into a dispatch queue that is continually processed via an internal, background service according to the throttling limits you've specified. If events are received faster than they can be dispatched they are queued, in memory, until resources are freed up. 

There is a built-in monitoring of this queue that will automatically [record a log event](../logging/subscription-events.md#subscription-event-dispatch-queue-alert) when a given threshold is reached. 

#### Default Event Alert Threshold
This event is recorded at a `Critical` level when the queue reaches `10,000 events`. This alert is then re-recorded once every 5 minutes if the 
queue remains above 10,000 events.

#### Custom Event Alert Thresholds

In some high volume scenarios, its not uncommon or unexpected for the dispatch queue to spike beyond the default monitoring levels from time to time.  If you need more granular control of the notifications, register an instance of `ISubscriptionClientDispatchQueueAlertSettings` to your DI container before adding GraphQL and your settings will be used instead.

In the example below, if the queue reaches 1,000 events, the debug level alert will be recorded. If 30 seconds pass and the queue is still above 1000 events, the debug level alert will be recorded again. However, if the queue crosses 10,000 events then the warning level alert will be recorded (the debug alert is then ignored).  If the queue reaches 100k events then a critical level alert will be recorded every 15 seconds until it drops below 100k.

 Lower level thresholds (as determined by number of queued events) will not be triggered if a higher level is on active cool down.

```csharp title="Custom Dispatch Queue Monitoring"
// startup configuration

var thresholds = new SubscriptionClientDispatchQueueAlertSettings();
thresholds.AddThreshold(
    LogLevel.Debug,
    1000,
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));

thresholds.AddThreshold(
    LogLevel.Warning,
    10000,
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(120));

thresholds.AddThreshold(
    LogLevel.Critical,
    100000,
    TimeSpan.FromSeconds(15));
    
// register as a singleton
// highlight-next-line
services.AddSingleton<ISubscriptionClientDispatchQueueAlertSettings>(alerts);

// normal graphql configuration
services.AddGraphQL()
        .AddSubscriptions();
```

> Consider using the built in `SubscriptionClientDispatchQueueAlertSettings` object for a standard implementation of the required interface.
