JavaScript certainly has the highest adoption rate and with the tools provided by Apollo its no surprise.

For most queries this process is near instantaneous but in some particularly large queries it may take an extra moment to generate a full query plan. The query cache will help alleviate this bottleneck by caching a plan for a set period of time to skip the parsing and generation phases when completing a request.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"reference/schema-configuration":{"id":"reference/schema-configuration","title":"Schema Configuration","description":"This document contains a list of various configuration settings available during schema configuration.

Anytime you want to pass more data than a single string or a number, perhaps an Address or a new Employee record, you use an INPUTOBJECT to represent that entity in GraphQL.  When the system scans your controllers, if it comes across a class or struct used as a parameter to a method it will attempt to generate the appropriate input type definition to represent that class.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"types/interfaces":{"id":"types/interfaces","title":"Interfaces","description":"Interfaces in GraphQL work like interfaces in C#, for the most part.
